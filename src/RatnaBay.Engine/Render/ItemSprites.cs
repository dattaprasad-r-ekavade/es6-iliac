/// each made of one material — a haft, a head, a socket, a blade. That is a description, and a
/// description is code. What genuinely cannot be generated is anything whose appeal comes from
/// an artist's *choices* rather than its construction: a face, a pose, a creature with
/// character. Those are still hand work, and nothing here pretends otherwise.
///
/// One light direction for the whole file, so every icon in the inventory agrees about where
/// the lamp is. Getting that wrong across a hand-drawn set takes constant discipline; here it
