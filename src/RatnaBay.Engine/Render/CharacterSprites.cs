/// <summary>
/// Characters, drawn in code.
///
/// This is the decision that sidesteps MonoGame's worst gap. A skinned, rigged humanoid needs
/// a mesh, a rig, retargeting and an animation system; a camera-facing quad needs none of
/// them, and it is what Daggerfall itself did. Because the texture is generated rather than
/// authored, a character is data — a palette and a few proportions — rather than an asset
/// somebody has to model.
///
/// Built on <see cref="SpriteForge"/>, which changes what "drawn in code" means here. The old
/// version stacked flat rectangles: a torso was one colour, an arm was one colour, and the
/// only thing separating them was that they were different colours. Now every part writes
/// thickness and the whole figure is lit at the end, from the same direction as every item
/// icon in the game. An arm in front of a torso is now readable because it is *rounder and
/// nearer*, not because somebody remembered to pick a different shade for it.
///
/// The palettes below are untouched, and deliberately so. Each flat colour becomes a five-step
/// ramp through <see cref="SpriteMaterial.FromBase"/>, so nothing that references a palette
/// had to change and the figures gained volume anyway.
