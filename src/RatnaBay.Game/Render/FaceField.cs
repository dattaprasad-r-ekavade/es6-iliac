/// The forge is right for everything it does and wrong for this, for two reasons that both
/// only bite at close range.
///
/// **It writes thickness, not form.** A shape's height comes from how far each pixel sits from
/// that shape's own outline, so every part is a flat-topped mesa with rounded edges. That is
/// perfect for a sword and hopeless for a face, because it cannot make a hollow: an eye socket
/// has to be *further back* than the cheek beside it, and a chamfer has no way to say so. Eyes
/// end up pasted on top of a forehead instead of set into one.
///
/// **And it quantises into a five-step ramp**, which is the entire reason the world sprites
/// read as pixel art. At thirty-two pixels that banding is the style. At three hundred it is
/// just banding.
///
/// So this stores a real height field in continuous units, composites parts with a **smooth
/// maximum** so they fuse into one surface rather than stacking with a depth test, allows
/// parts to be *subtracted* to carve sockets and folds, and lights the result with a key, a
/// fill, ambient occlusion and a rim — continuously, no ramp. Everything is computed at
/// <see cref="Supersample"/> times the output size and box-filtered down at the end, which is
/// what removes the staircase edges the forge has no answer for.
