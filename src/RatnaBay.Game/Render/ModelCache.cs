/// <summary>
/// Imported models: loaded once, measured once, and drawn at a size that means something.
///
/// **The first piece lifted out of <c>Game1</c>, and chosen because it is genuinely
/// self-contained.** It held five dictionaries and four methods in a 6,600-line class, and
/// depends on nothing but a content manager and the two camera matrices — no lights, no
/// palette, no shader, no screen state. Everything else in that file is more tangled than
/// this, so this is the one that could be moved without arguing about what it is allowed to
/// know.
///
/// **Normalising is the reason this is a cache rather than a dictionary.** An imported model
/// arrives at whatever scale its author used and centred wherever its origin happened to fall,
/// so placing two of them side by side with the same scale number gives one the size of a
/// house. Each model is measured on load — bounding spheres through their absolute bone
/// transforms — and stored with the centre offset and the reciprocal of its extent, so a
/// caller asking for scale 1.4 gets the same apparent size whatever the asset was.
///
/// **Lighting is applied once at load, not per mesh per frame.** <c>EnableDefaultLighting</c>
/// rewrites every light and reselects a shader permutation; it was running for every mesh of
/// every model, every frame, and the only things that actually change between frames are the
/// three matrices.
