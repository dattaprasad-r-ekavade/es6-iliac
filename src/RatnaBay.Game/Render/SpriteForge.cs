/// A software canvas for building sprites out of shapes and light, rather than out of pixels.

/// pixel is from the shape's own edge, and only at the end is that height field lit, quantised
/// into a material's ramp, and given an outline.

/// Doing it this way is what buys the fidelity. A pixel written directly is flat forever; a
/// pixel that knows how thick the object is there can be lit, can catch a highlight on the
/// side facing the lamp, and can fall into shadow on the side that does not — which is the
/// entire difference between a coloured silhouette and something that looks modelled.
///
/// It also means one lighting decision governs every asset in the game at once. Move the light
/// here and the sword, the pickaxe and the preta all relight together, consistently, for free.
